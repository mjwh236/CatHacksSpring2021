# CatHacksSpring2021
:smile_cat: This is our project for CatHacks Spring 2021 :smile_cat:

# Objective
Our objective for this project was to create a psuedo-hacking game in the form of a website.
The theme is that the player is a young individual from the lower class trying to hack :desktop_computer: into the Mega Corporation known as DFIING (pronounced 'defying').
Hopefully you can find the files on their systems to leak to the public and expose DFIING.
